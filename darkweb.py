You are smacked by another overpowering boost of adrenaline as you slowly edge your mouse cursor over to DarK_XZY, a special program 
which lets you plunge into the mysterious void that is the Dark Web.
Click! Click! You open the program.
A terminal appears. Shakily you move your cursor over to a command line. You enter in the command:

EXP10RE --DARK_WB


Your screen suddenly lights up. The fans in your pc start to whirr vigorously. Perhaps this wasn't such a good idea, but it's too late now...
The speakers start letting out rapid beeping noises, as if it was crying out from the immense strain on the computer using morse code.
Everything begins to pixelate, and odd colours start flashing randomly across the screen. And then... nothing. Your computer's CPU flatlines.
Until, suddenly, it jolts to life. Your old OS is gone. The only thing that meets your eyes is a sickly black screen with a new login page.


Some text appears on the screen. 

Press enter to continue.
